## Introduction
[explain background, sources]
Sign languages are vastly under researched. Computational sign language research is even less common. With this project we hope to offer a small contribution to this field based on previous work from Mudd et al. (2020). Their research involves an ABM model that simulates the spread and persistence of sign language in the case of Deaf-hearing mixed communities.</br>
Their base input variables are informed by data of Kata Kolok, a sign language spoken in the north of Bali, Indonesia.

## Research Question
[RQ + hypothesis]

## Results
[our results]
We reused the input variables of Mudd et al. (2020), as listed here:</br>
* Number of people in the first generation = ~730
* Preference for marrying similar agents = 58%
* Percentage of Deaf people = 2.2%
* Percentage of hearing carrriers of Deaf genes = 17.6%
* Number of generations to run the model for = 50

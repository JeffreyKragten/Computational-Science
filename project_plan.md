# Project plan
## Project title (max. 200 characters): <fill this last, after the other details are decided>
Team members: <Ray Pelupessy; Luuk van der Waals; Jeffrey Kragten>
Team number and team name (optional):

## Scientific question (max. 350 words)
<This should include: problem context, description of the investigated scientific phenomenon within 
the given context with clear research questions/hypotheses, up to 3 references (please use APA 
citation format if possible, references do NOT count against the word limit).>
Sign language is primarily used by deaf people, but the use of sign language is not completely dependent on
how many deaf people are in a community. We want to look at how sign language spreads within a community
across multiple generations, and whether the percentage of deaf people in the community
affects the number of signers.

## Numerical method (max 100 words)
We will used an agent-based model to simulate the spread and retention of sign language in a population.
The agents in our simluation are persons with (primarily familial) relations to each other. The agents
will age and start families and other relational bonds, these bonds have the potention to spread or retain
sign language. We will validate our model by comparing it to the spread and retention seen in the data of (Mudd et al., 2020).

## Provisioned tools (max 100 words): 
We plan one using python in Jupyter Notebook. Although programs like NetLogo are specialised in Agent-Based models, 
these are more focused on the 2d simulations while we are more focused on the network of the people. 
In python we have the freedom to create a network with agents in the way we want for our model.
We will use the python module matplotlib for visualization of data.

## Plan for division of work (max 100 words):
We will all be part of the decision processes with regards to the scientific question, the method of investigation,
the tools we use and the planned timeline. Subsequently, we will all work on the coding of our model,
the literature study and writing the report. However, Ray will be ultimately responsible for the literature study,
Luuk and Jeffrey will be ultimately responsible for the building of the model,
and all three will be responsible for the (design) choices and analysis written in the report.

## Timeline (max 100 words):
<A short timeline plan from the start of the project till the end of the course. Keep it concise and 
realistic, no complicated GANT is necessary.>

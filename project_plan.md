# Project plan
## Project title (max. 200 characters): The silent minority

Team number and team name (optional):

## Scientific question (max. 350 words)
Sign language is primarily used by deaf people, but the use of sign language is not completely dependent on
how many deaf people are in a community. We want to look at how sign language spreads within a community
across multiple generations, and whether the percentage of deaf people in the community
affects the number of signers.
Our research question is as follows:
Are familial bonds capable of retaining sign language over multiple generations?
We will primrily be referencing the following paper:
Mudd, K., de Vos, C., & de Boer, B. (2020). An agent-based model of sign language persistence informed by real-world data.
Language Dynamics and Change, 10(2), 158â€“187. https://doi.org/10.1163/22105832-bja10010
As a follow-up question we would like to investigate the effect of incorperating different stages of language acquisiting.

## Numerical method (max 100 words)
We will use an agent-based model to simulate the spread and retention of sign language in a population.
The agents in our simluation are persons with (primarily familial) relations to each other. The agents
will age and start families and other relational bonds, these bonds have the potential to spread or retain
sign language. We will validate our model by comparing it to the spread and retention seen in the data of Mudd et al. (2020).

## Provisioned tools (max 100 words): 
We plan one using python in Jupyter Notebook. Although programs like NetLogo are specialised in Agent-Based models, 
these are more focused on the 2d simulations while we are more focused on the network of the people. 
In python we have the freedom to create a network with agents in the way we want for our model.
We will use the python module matplotlib for visualization of data.

## Plan for division of work (max 100 words):
We will all be part of the decision processes with regards to the scientific question, the method of investigation,
the tools we use and the planned timeline. Subsequently, we will all work on the coding of our model,
the literature study and writing the report. However, Ray will be ultimately responsible for the literature study,
Luuk and Jeffrey will be ultimately responsible for the building of the model,
and all three will be responsible for the (design) choices and analysis written in the report.

# Project plan
## Project title (max. 200 characters): <fill this last, after the other details are decided>
Team members: <name1; name2; name3>
Team number and team name (optional):

## Scientific question (max. 350 words)
<This should include: problem context, description of the investigated scientific phenomenon within 
the given context with clear research questions/hypotheses, up to 3 references (please use APA 
citation format if possible, references do NOT count against the word limit).>
Sign language is primarily used by deaf people, but the use of sign language is not completely dependent on
how many deaf people are in a community. We want to look at how sign language spreads within a community
across multiple generations, and whether the percentage of deaf people in the community
affects the number of signers.

## Numerical method (max 100 words)
<State the chosen numerical method and describe the way that you intend to use AND validate your 
model.>

## Provisioned tools (max 100 words): 
We plan one using python in Jupyter Notebook. Although programs like NetLogo are specialised in Agent-Based models, these are more focused on the 2d simulations while we are more focused on the network of the people. In python we have the freedom to create a network with agents in the way we want for our model.

## Plan for division of work (max 100 words):
We will all be part of the decision processes with regards to the scientific question, the method of investigation, the tools we use and the planned timeline. Subsequently, we will all work on the coding of our model, the literature study and writing the report. However, Rae will be ultimately responsable for the literature study, Luuk and Jeffrey will be ultimately responsable for the building of the model, and all three will be responsible for the (design) choices and analysis written in the report.

## Timeline (max 100 words):
<A short timeline plan from the start of the project till the end of the course. Keep it concise and 
realistic, no complicated GANT is necessary.>
